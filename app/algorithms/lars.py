def lars(y, X, max_sum_coeffs=None, min_coeff=0, sigma=None):
    '''Given an observation vector y and a column basis X, compute LARS.
    This computes an encoding \beta that minimizes 1/2 ||y - X\beta||^2, subject
    to the constraint that |\beta_i| sum to less than some fixed limit. Beta is
    generated iteratively given the residual r by choosing the maximally
    responding column of X and moving r in that direction until the correlation
    between r and the maximal X equals the correlation between r and some "newly
    active" column in X.
    y is a vector of "response" variables that we are trying to encode. The mean
    of y must be 0.
    X is a matrix of covariates (one per column ; each column must be
    zero-centered and of unit length) to use for the regression.
    If max_sum_coeffs is a positive real, then the algorithm will halt once the
    sum-of-coefficients constraint above is violated.
    If min_coeff is a positive real, the algorithm will halt once the maximally
    responding column(s) in X have less than this response magnitude.
    If both max_sum_coeffs and min_coeff are None, then the algorithm will halt
    when the risk induced by the regression coefficients starts to grow. In this
    case, sigma should be an estimate of the standard deviation of the elements
    of y, if they had been drawn IID from N(0, sigma^2). If it is not given,
    y.std() will be used.
    This implementation is based on Efron, Hastie, Johnstone, and Tibshirani's
    2004 paper, "Least Angle Regression," especially the equations on pages 413
    and 414.
